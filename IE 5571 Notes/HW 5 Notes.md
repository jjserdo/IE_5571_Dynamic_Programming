Textbook problems 7.4 and 7.6.

Project proposal: For your proposal you can either do a theoretical project or an applied project. For the theoretical project, you will read a recent theoretical RL paper and then write a report discussing the paper along with possible extensions. For the applied project you will apply RL methods to solve a problem that you describe, this will require implementing RL methods.

If you are doing an applied project your proposal should describe the problem you are going to solve along with the reinforcement learning techniques you will use to solve it. You should try to give a brief background on the problem, including why it is difficult to solve and why it is important to solve.Â  If you are doing a theoretical project you should mention the type of theoretical papers you are interested in, and mention at least three possible papers.

Each member of a group (up to 3 people) is responsible for submitting a copy of the proposal with all group member names on the proposal.

The proposal should be 300-500 words.
